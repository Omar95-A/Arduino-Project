## About_Project

### Intro

Smart Hand Sanitizer Machine Project (Sens√∂rl√º El Dezenfektan Makinesinin Projesi). It's Software Engineering College Project. YM√ú338 Microprocessors and Programming (YM√ú338 Mikroi≈ülemciler ve Programlama) Bachelor's Project.

### Project Components
Smart Hand Sanitizer Machine Project composed of:
- Arduino Uno board
- Arduino Uno USB Cable
- Large breadboard
- Distance sensor
- Servo Motor
- 4X4 Membrane Keypad
- Two LED
- One Buzzer
- Two Electrical Resistance
- Liquid Soap
- Code on the Arduino IDE program


## How_The_Project_Works

When an analog signal is generated in front of the sensor, the servo motor will be instructed to move to a certain degree according to the code written in its program in the arduino IDE, while the Microcontroller is programmed on the Arduino board via the Arduino IDE program using a USB cable. When the Distance Sensor detects motion within the sensor area, it will use a Servo Motor to make a motion to press the liquid soap high part out to use it.
