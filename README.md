## About_Project

### Introduction

In covid-19 pandemic period which is a global outbreak, hand hygiene is the core preventive measure in the spread of the disease with COVID-19 transmission mainly spreading between people through direct, indirect (through contaminated objects or surfaces), or close contact with infected people via mouth and nose secretions, washing hands with soap and running water is of critical importance. In order to eliminate most of the germs on the hands, one needs to apply a good hand washing practice but this will make the hand sanitizer dispenser to be contaminated.
<br><br>
The main objective of this project is to work on a smart hand sanitizer machine that this machine work without touching a liquid soap box, in order to reduce the spread of the covid-19 virus. The method used to achieve the objectives of this project is by using the Arduino. In addition to the way the smart hand sanitizer machine  works by means of a sensor, I will also add to this project the possibility of working a this machine based on a password to learn how to work passwords with machines b using Arduino.

### Project Components
Smart Hand Sanitizer Machine Project composed of:
- Arduino Uno board
- Arduino Uno USB Cable
- Large breadboard
- Distance sensor
- Servo Motor
- 4X4 Membrane Keypad
- Two LED
- One Buzzer
- Two Electrical Resistance
- Liquid Soap Box
- Code on the Arduino IDE program

For more details about the project components you can read the [Project Report](https://github.com/Omar95-A/Arduino-Project/blob/main/Project%20Report.pdf).

## How_The_Project_Works

When an analog signal is generated in front of the sensor, the servo motor will be instructed to move to a certain degree according to the code written in its program in the arduino IDE, while the Microcontroller is programmed on the Arduino board via the `Arduino IDE` program using a USB cable. When the Distance Sensor detects motion within the sensor area, it will use a Servo Motor to make a motion to press the liquid soap box high part out to use it.

## Source_Code

You need to include some of libraries in code like:

- To use the Membrane Keypad:

```bash
#include <Keypad.h>
```

- To use the Servo Motor:

```bash
#include<Servo.h>
```

<br>

```bash
#define ledr 6
#define ledb 7
#define trig 8
#define echo 9
#define buzzer 12

int kere = 0;
const byte ROWS = 4; 
const byte COLS = 4;
char keys[ROWS][COLS] = {
  {'1','2','3','A'},
  {'4','5','6','B'},
  {'7','8','9','C'},
  {'*','0','#','D'}
};
byte rowPins[ROWS] = {A2, A3, A4, A5};
byte colPins[COLS] = {5, 4, 3, 2};

Keypad keypad = Keypad( makeKeymap(keys), rowPins, colPins, ROWS, COLS );
char pass[4];
char storepass[] = "1234";
int i,count, pos = 0; 
Servo myservo;

void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:

}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

}
```
